# 3. You can press the step over button.

# 4. The step into command will switch to the top of the method that is on the same line as the breakpoint to begin debugging the method.

# 5. Evaluate expression lets you evaluate the line of code you are currently on whereas evaluate code fragment lets you do the same except you can also write temporary methods/variables to evaluate.
